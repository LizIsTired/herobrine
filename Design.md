Starting off, I'd like to address my motivation. I've been out of Minecraft modding for a while but have had this idea that I had yet to do something with. I'd like to come back a little into the space because I love coding, learning, and the community. 

This initally started off with the idea of a Herobrine-like entity that only appears in screenshots.

It has since evolved to adding the Herobrine entity itself into the game as an enemy.

Now there's a few things to mention here with this. There are no completely thought out ideas.


I want there to be scripted events. I'll list the one's I can imagine right now:

- When the biome plays a mood sound, spawn a Herobrine nearby in an air pocket. (continued below)
- Have the Herobrine either walk slowly and fly through blocks until it touches the player and plays an affect and vanishes. (continued below)
- Have an event similar to the Elder Guardian jumpscare with eyes.
- Spawn the Herobrine boss when the spawning structure is made.
- When the player goes through the Nether Portal, start spawning Herobrines. Limit to 1.
- When the player takes a screenshot, place a Herobrine just out of visible sight for that one frame.


I found [another mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endofherobrine) that adds Herobrine related things, including a new biome in the future and this is a fantastic idea. While some of the ideas we have are similar I want a different direction for a lot of the ideas.

I want this mod to be something you install, forget about and then all of a sudden have to deal with in your world. I want it to be a problem, a menace until you fight the boss version and kill him once and for all. And then after that, who knows.
